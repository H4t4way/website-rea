I am Reando, but you can call me h4t4way. **I am a penetration tester and occasional bug hunter**. As a lover of WebSec, I always like to find something wrong and fix it !!!! :) I have been passionate about computer science since childhood and have been in the world of security for five and a half years. 

My research interests include distributed robotics, mobile computing, and programmable matter. He leads the Robotic Neurobiology group that develops self-configuring robots, self-organising robotic systems, and mobile sensor networks.
